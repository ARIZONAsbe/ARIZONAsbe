<h1 align="center"><b>Hey there! 🙌</b></h1>
<h2 align="center">My name is Krystian Kamiński, Junior Front-End Developer from Poland.</h2><br>

<p align="center">After my 3,5 year journey with Computer Science studies I found myself intrigued in creating Websites and Web Applications.</p><br>
<p align="center">You might ask me <q>Krystian, but why exactly Front-End, if you had a little bit of experience with Java, C#, Android Development, Arduino, and even Assembler (🤓)?</q> Well, I thought about how much of novadays services, apps, social-medias are web-based. The simplicity for end-user to just open it in a browser on a mobile device, computer, TV, or even a smart-fridge is inspiring. And if the UI is intuitive, looks good and UX is great - we're the winners!</p><br>
